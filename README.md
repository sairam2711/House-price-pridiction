House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
This repository contains the code for predicting house prices using machine learning algorithms. The goal of the project is to build a model that can predict house prices based on various features such as the size of the house, number of rooms, location, etc.

About
In this project, we apply machine learning techniques to predict house prices based on various features. The model is trained using regression algorithms to understand the relationship between different input features (like the number of bedrooms, square footage, etc.) and the house price.

We used popular datasets to train the model, applied data preprocessing, and evaluated different algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests to compare their performance.

Technologies Used
Python: The main programming language used in the project.
Libraries:
pandas for data manipulation and analysis
numpy for numerical computations
matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization
scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
jupyter notebook for an interactive coding environment
Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
pip (Python package installer)
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:


git clone https://github.com/sairam2711/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction
Install the required dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Launch the Jupyter notebook to start working on the project:

bash

jupyter notebook
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available here. It contains information about house sales, including features such as:

Square footage
Number of bedrooms
Number of bathrooms
Floor area
Location
And more...
Usage
Once the environment is set up, open the Jupyter notebook to explore and execute the code. The notebook includes steps such as:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data and preparing it for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the data to identify trends and relationships.
Model Training: Training different machine learning models on the dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the models based on various metrics.
Prediction: Using the trained model to predict house prices.
